Django Logins for phpBB
=======================

This project contains the code required to set up your site so that people can log
in using Django authentication, and then post to a phpBB forum without having to 
log in again.  As such it is (obviously) dependent on Django and phpBB.

It comprises two sections:

* The django code.  This is a Django app called sessionprofile.  Its README.txt
  tells you how to add it to your project.
  
* The phpBB code.  This needs to be installed in your phpBB directory; details are 
  in the included README.txt file.
  
All code and documentation is made available under an MIT license.
