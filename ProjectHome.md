This project contains the code required to set up your site so that people can log in using Django authentication, and then post to a phpBB forum without having to log in again or create a separate login.  As such it is (obviously) dependent on Django and phpBB.

The documentation is all in the various `README.txt` files checked into the source code repository.  You can also refer to the [original blog post about the project](http://www.gilesthomas.com/?p=63), which has a walkthough of some of the code.

If you have any questions, please contact giles@giles.net
